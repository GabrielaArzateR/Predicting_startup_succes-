    "**Introduction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, startups have emerged as significant and influential forces in the business world, disrupting industries and reshaping entrepreneurship. They are becoming the driving force behind our economy. Examples like Uber and Airbnb are changing societies in such impactful ways that regulation had to be created to keep pace with a new reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dynamic startup world, success is a rare gem.The success of a company is defined as the event that gives the company's founders a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what makes these high-risk ventures successful is a relevant challenge for investors and entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some become unicorns valued at over $1 billion, many face challenges and close shop. Predicting success becomes a competitive advantage for venture capitalists seeking investments, allowing them to stay one step ahead of the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of technology on startups is undeniable. Technology has helped bridge the gap between entrepreneurs and potential investors, leading to more successful startups and increased investments in the industry. It has also opened up a host of opportunities for entrepreneurs to reach new markets and develop innovative products.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a focus on how a start-up or an investor could explore all this knowledge for a better decision\n",
    "making in investment strategy and monetary gain, the study intends, by applying data mining and\n",
    "machine learning techniques, to create a predictive model that has as the dependent variable a label\n",
    "to classify whether a start-up is (already) successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved areas of our society are already being improved by the application of machine learning.\n",
    "From healthcare, where by applying segmentation and predictive modelling it is possible to identify\n",
    "different types of treatment (from preventive to life-style changes) for a patient or even diagnose\n",
    "him (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2014), to marketing personalization where companies benefit from\n",
    "knowing as much as possible from their clients to create customer-centric experiences all around.\n",
    "Fraud detection, financial services, insurance and even smart cars are all industries creating value, in a short to medium term, through the application of machine learning (Marr, 2016). It is possible to\n",
    "bring similar advantages to investors in start-ups, by giving these players information about which\n",
    "start-ups are closer to a successful event in their near future they can better choose where to put\n",
    "their chips and have higher returns on their investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the predictive model, three supervised machine learning algorithms were tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Random Forests.\n",
    "  \n",
    "All these algorithms fit the characteristics of the dataset (147 features and more than 140 000 observations), provide a fast and PREDICTING SUCCESS FOR START-UPS WITH MACHINE LEARNING 10 simple technical implementation\n",
    "with the objective of building a predictive model, through supervised learning, to accurately classify which start-ups are successful and which aren’t. \n",
    "With the evolution of information technologies, obtaining highly reliable results in data analysis has become feasible. This is achieved by employing intricate machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques to manipulate data, define features, and establish robust models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The present work has as the main objective, the development of a predictive model to classify a\n",
    "start-up/company as successful or not (binary classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent works, such as A Supervised Approach to Predict Company Acquisition with Factual\n",
    "and Topic Features Using Profiles and News Article, on predictive analysis (using the same dataset) on\n",
    "start-up success rate shows there is room for improvement. Previous studies tend to focus primarily\n",
    "on managerial features and often overview the impact of financial features related with funding\n",
    "(specially from Venture Capital funds). It is intended to bridge this gap by creating funding-oriented\n",
    "features with good predictive impact in classifying successful companies. Additionally, there is room\n",
    "to improve the quality of the sample by being more selective with \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**About Dataset**\n",
    "**DATA COLLECTION AND SELECTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data utilized in this study is the complete structured database sourced from the world's largest data science community, www.kaggle.com.  and was acquired on 2023-01-04. \n",
    "It is important to disclaim that the data is accessible and distributed under the CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license. This signifies that the data is within the public domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of a predictive model to explain this specific phenomenon is an excellent indicator of how the level of exploitation of Data Mining techniques allows analysts to extract the full potential of the available data to reach all proposed goals. Being able to accurately classify if a start-up had this event in its progress is not only incredibly valuable for\n",
    "all the players in the start-up world (entrepreneurs, angels and investors of Venture Capital) but also,the application of different techniques and features to build models with higher predictive accuracy represents a step forward to not only the academic literature but also the industry."
