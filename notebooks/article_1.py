# # Data Insight: Top Factors For Startup Success
# 
# Learn about the **factors** that makes startups get acquired and **how** to apply exploratory data analysis to identify these factors.
# 
# We will explore the [Startup Success Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction) released on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains information about industries, acquisitions, and investment details of nearly a thousand startups based in the USA from the 1980s to 2013.
# 
# It's essential to understand how to transform raw data into meaningful information. To achieve this, we will follow the workflow below: 
# 
# 1. Data exploration
# 2. Pre-processing 
# 3. Data analysis 
# 4. Data-driven conclusions
# 
# 
# Here are the main objectives of our analysis:
# 
# - Examine the industries where startup acquisitions are most common.
# - Examine whether reaching certain milestones increases a startup's likelihood of acquisition. 
# - Analyze the average total funding of startups that get acquired versus those that close.
# - Compare success rates of startups with Series A, B, or C funding to those supported by angel investors or VC
# 
# Let's begin by understanding some concepts related to startups.
# 
# ## Understanding the Startup Ecosystem
# In the startup field, startups raise money in stages called **funding rounds**, like Series A, B, or C. These rounds enables the startups to invest in the necessary resources for their growth. Second, startups set goals called **milestones**, like launching a product or getting a certain number of users. These reflect their performance to the investors.
# 
# Finally, startups secure funding from two types of source:
# - **Angel investors** are high net worth individuals who provide personal capital for investment.
# - **Venture capital firms** are corporate entities specializing in investing in startups.
# 
# Letâ€™s get in to the preliminary steps. 

# ## Data Exploration

# Data exploration is the first step in data analysis. It involves examining datasets to identify patterns and anomalies.
# 
# The following libraries provide the necessary tools and functions for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

# In[66]:


import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
from scipy.stats import zscore


# Now, we load the data into a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame.

# In[67]:


file_path = os.path.join('..', 'data', 'startup.csv')
data_df = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding="ISO-8859-1")


# In[68]:


columns_to_copy = ["status", "state_code", "category_code"]
categorical_data = data_df[columns_to_copy].copy()


# Next, let's focus on understanding the significance of the **Target Variable**.
# 
# The `status` variable is the most important feature in this dataset. This binary variable indicates whether a startup has been acquired or closed.

# In[69]:


# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data_df)

# Creating a binary variable
df['binary_status'] = df['status'].map({'acquired': 1, 'closed': 0})

# Counting the occurrences of each status
status_counts = df['binary_status'].value_counts()

# Plotting the bar plot
plt.bar(status_counts.index, status_counts.values, color=['green', 'red'])
plt.xticks([0, 1], ['Closed','Acquired'])
plt.xlabel('Status')
plt.ylabel('Number of Startups')
plt.title('Acquired vs. Closed Startups')
plt.show()


# When analyzing the variable, it shows that 597 startups in our dataset were acquired, while 326 startups closed down.
# 
# With the target variable identified, let's proceed to data preparation.

# ## Data Pre-processing

# The pre-processing step involves cleaning and organizing the raw data.
# We'll accomplish following these steps:
# 
# The **Data cleaning** step consists on identifying and correcting data errors, such as typos, duplicates, or incorrect entries. It is essential for maintaining data integrity. We'll focus on handling:
# -  The irrelevant features
# -  The missing values
# -  The negative values where it shouldn't be so.
# 
# The **Data transformation** step modifies data to re-organize them into a format appropriate for performing analysis. These are the common transformation that we will perform:
# -  **Normalization** and **standardization**: These techniques adjust data to a common scale, making it easier to compare them.
# -  **Encoding categorical data**: Transforming categorical variables into numerical formats.
# 

# ### Handle Irrelevant Features

# An irrelevant feature is a data attribute or variable that doesn't offer useful or meaningful information for the task. Here are some reasons why removing them is beneficial:
# 
# - Eliminating irrelevant variables simplifies the analysis process.
# - It ensures focus on meaningful factors by reducing unnecessary information and improving clarity in data exploration.
# 
# To continue, we'll remove the following variables and explain why for each.

# In[70]:


data_df = data_df.drop([
    'Unnamed: 0',   # Irrelevant data
    'latitude',     # Irrelevant data
    'longitude',    # Irrelevant data
    'zip_code',     # Irrelevant data
    'id',           # Irrelevant data
    'Unnamed: 6',   # Irrelevant data
    'name',         # Irrelevant data
    'labels',       # Same data as status
    'state_code.1', # Same data as state_code
    'is_CA',        # Binary column, not needed 
    'is_NY',        # Binary column, not needed
    'is_MA',        # Binary column, not needed
    'is_TX',        # Binary column, not needed
    'is_otherstate',# Binary column, not needed
    'is_software',  # Binary column, not needed
    'is_web',       # Binary column, not needed
    'is_mobile',    # Binary column, not needed
    'is_enterprise',# Binary column, not needed
    'is_advertising',# Binary column, not needed
    'is_gamesvideo',# Binary column, not needed
    'is_ecommerce', # Binary column, not needed
    'is_biotech',   # Binary column, not needed
    'is_consulting',# Binary column, not needed
    'is_othercategory',# Binary column, not needed
    'object_id'],   # Irrelevant data
    axis=1,
).copy()
data_df.head(2)


# We've simplified the DataFrame. From 50 columns initially, it now contains 24 columns. Let's examine the data.

# In[71]:


data_df.info()


# A preliminary review allows us to understand the nature of the data, especially focusing on identifying key data types that will help us to make decisions.
# After discarding irrelevant variables we continue handle the Missing values.

#  ### Missing Values

# Missing values (NA) are data points in a dataset where information is simply not available or recorded for a specific attribute or variable. 
# 
# Importance of **handling** missing values:
# 
# - Preserve the integrity of your dataset. Without proper handling, NA can lead to biased or misleading results in statistical analyses. 
#  
# - Maintain the reliability of your analyses, making them more robust and trustworthy.

# In[72]:


x= data_df.isnull().sum()
x.sort_values(ascending=False)


# It's important to remember that handling NA varies based on data characteristics and analysis goals. The chosen method should be tailored to each case.
# 
# As shown above, we've identified **three features** that contain missing values.
# 
# Given that `age_first_milestone_year` and `age_last_milestone_year` are continuous numerical variables, our chosen imputation method will involve filling the missing values with the respective means for these variables. To accomplish this, we will apply the following method.

#  **Fillna() Method** provides:
# 
# - Flexibility in handling missing data by replacing NaN values with custom alternatives, like specific numbers, text, or computed values.
#   
# This method works well for continuous numerical variables and retains the original distribution by centering values around the data's central tendency.

# In[73]:


data_df["age_first_milestone_year"] = data_df["age_first_milestone_year"].fillna(data_df["age_first_milestone_year"].mean())
data_df["age_last_milestone_year"] = data_df["age_last_milestone_year"].fillna(data_df["age_last_milestone_year"].mean())


# In[74]:


data= data_df.isnull().sum()
data.sort_values(ascending=False)


# **General Changes:**
# 
# - Imputed values for `age_first_milestone_year` and `age_last_milestone_year`.
#   
# - Missing values in `closed_at` represent startups that are still open and will not be filled for now. This approach preserves the information that certain startups are still active without arbitrarily assigning a closure date. 
#   
# Now that we've established the significance of handling missing values, let's proceed with the next step.

# ### Negative values

# Negative values can be important indicators, especially in financial data where they often represent debt or losses. Removing them without careful consideration could result in missing critical information. 
# 
# However, in other contexts, negative numbers might indicate errors or require changes to the data.
# 
# Before we continue, we will convert the following columns into datetime format to ensure that they are suitable for time based analysis.

# In[75]:


data_df.founded_at=pd.to_datetime(data_df.founded_at)
data_df.first_funding_at=pd.to_datetime(data_df.first_funding_at)
data_df.last_funding_at=pd.to_datetime(data_df.last_funding_at)


# To find negative values, we'll use **box plots**. Box plots make it easy to spot and fix negative values that could be mistakes or unusual data.
# 
# According to our data set, most of the features are binary which are not suitable for negative values detection, therefore we will consider only the following continuous variables.

# In[76]:


continuous_variables = ['avg_participants','age_first_funding_year','age_last_funding_year','age_first_milestone_year','age_last_milestone_year']
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
for i in range(0, len(continuous_variables)):
    plt.subplot(1, len(continuous_variables), i+1)
    sns.boxplot(y=data_df[continuous_variables[i]], color='blue', orient='v')
    plt.tight_layout()


# **Box plots** show us these main observations:
#   
# - In box plots 2, 3, 4, and 5, the points that appear outside the main body of the box plot represent values that are outside the typical range of the dataset. 
# 
# - The points lying above the upper whisker represent the positive outliers. We will address these in a later stage of our analysis.
# 
# Let's now look at how two variables relate to each other and spot negative values using scatter plots. 
# 
# **Scatter plots** help us see the connection between two variables, making it easier to find unusual points or negative values when we look at them together.

# In[77]:


def outliers_analysis(data_df):
    # Perform calculations and add results as new columns in the DataFrame

# From the **scatterplot** we identified the following: 
# 
# - Negative values are highlighted in red, while positive values are indicated in blue.
# 
# - The occurrence of negative values could be attributed to several reasons, such a data entry errors, or a relative timing. However, without definitive context, we cannot be certain of the exact cause.
# 
# For the purposes of our analysis, we'll focus on how to handle these negative values. By doing so, we can maintain the integrity of our analysis and ensure that our insights are based on accurate and representative data.
# 
# Let's identify which column specifically contains negative values.

# In[78]:


columns_to_check  = ["age_first_funding_year", "age_last_funding_year", "age_first_milestone_year", "age_last_milestone_year"]
for column in columns_to_check :
    has_negative_values = (data_df[column] < 0).any()
    print(f"Negative values in '{column}' column: {has_negative_values}")


# #### Handle Negative Values

# Once we've identified them, we can proceed to address them with the following function.
# 
# **abs()function** is a valuable tool in data manipulation and numerical analysis for quickly and reliably obtaining absolute values. By taking the **absolute values** (converting them to positive values), you remove the negative sign and focus on the magnitude or distance from zero. 

# In[79]:


data_df["age_first_funding_year"]=np.abs(data_df["age_first_funding_year"])
data_df["age_last_funding_year"]=np.abs(data_df["age_last_funding_year"])
data_df["age_first_milestone_year"]=np.abs(data_df["age_first_milestone_year"])
data_df["age_last_milestone_year"]=np.abs(data_df["age_last_milestone_year"])


# After appliying the function we can use the following code to confirm it.

# In[80]:


columns_to_check  = ["age_first_funding_year", "age_last_funding_year", "age_first_milestone_year", "age_last_milestone_year"]
for column in columns_to_check :
    has_negative_values = (data_df[column] < 0).any()
    print(f"Negative values in '{column}' column: {has_negative_values}")


#  In outlier detection or anomaly detection tasks, absolute values can help identify extreme deviations regardless of their direction.
# 
# Let's observe how the plot changed after removing negative values.

def identify_outliers(data_df):

# The outcome was a cleaner dataset, with all negative values successfully removed.
# 
# This time, we focus on the positive outliers (the red points) that were identified using the **z-score** method in our visualization. Let's proceed to analyze this method in detail.

#  ### Outliers

# Outliers are extreme values in a dataset.  Earlier, we use methods such as **Box Plot** and **Scatter Plot**.
# 
# We will delve into other two methods to identify the outliers:
# 
# - **Histograms** to observe data distribution and spot anomalies.
# - Statistical methods as **Z-scores**.
# 
# By closely looking at the histogram, we can see if there are any data points that are very different from the usual range of values. These outliers often show up as isolated bars or spikes on the histogram.
# 
# Let's determine which variables have the highest number of outliers.

# In[82]:


# Select only numeric columns for histogram plots
specific_variables = [
    "age_first_funding_year", "age_last_funding_year",
    "age_first_milestone_year", "age_last_milestone_year", 
    "funding_total_usd", "funding_rounds", 
    "milestones", "relationships"
]
# Determine the number of rows and columns for the subplots
num_variables = len(specific_variables)
num_columns = 5  
num_rows = int(np.ceil(num_variables / num_columns))

# Set the overall figure size 
fig_width = num_columns * 6  
fig_height = num_rows * 5    

plt.figure(figsize=(fig_width, fig_height))

for i, column in enumerate(specific_variables):
    plt.subplot(num_rows, num_columns, i+1)
    plt.title(column, fontsize=25)
    sns.histplot(data_df[column], color="red", kde=True)  # Adding KDE for smooth distribution curve.
    plt.xlabel('')  
    plt.ylabel('') 

# Adjust layout to prevent overlap
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


# As observed in the histogram, noticeable spikes are apparent in the data. Excluding binary variables, the variables with the most prominent spikes are:
# 
# - `age_first_funding_year` 
# - `age_first_milestone_year`
# - `age_last_milestone_year`
# - `funding_total_usd`
# - `relationships`
# 
# Lets now determinate how much our dataset is affected by unusual data points. To do that we will use the following function.
# 
# **Z-scores** help us see how different a data point is from the average (mean) of the dataset. We will apply this method to one of the columns that has a higher number of outliers `age_first_milestone_year`.

# In[83]:


zscores_column =zscore(data_df["age_first_milestone_year"])
for threshold in range(1,6,1):
    print("Threshold value: {}". format(threshold))
    print("Number of outliers: {}".format(len(np.where(zscores_column >threshold)[0])))


# Analyzing the z-scores for the `age_first_milestone_year` column demonstrates how lowering z-score thresholds increases outlier detection flexibility to suit specific needs.
# 
# Now that we have identified outliers in our data, the next step is normalization. We will utilize the log-transformed method for this purpose.

# #### Handle Outliers

# To handle this outliers we will use **The log-transformed method** that involves taking the natural logarithm (ln) of each data point in a dataset. It's useful when data has a wide range of values, helping to balance the data.
# 
# The following graph illustrates the dataset before and after applying log transformation.

# In[84]:


age_features = ["age_first_funding_year", "age_last_funding_year", "age_first_milestone_year", "age_last_milestone_year"]

# Create a figure with a specific size
plt.figure(figsize=(17, 6), dpi=100)

# Loop through the list of variables
for i, variable in enumerate(age_features):
    # Regular histogram
    plt.subplot(2, 4, i + 1)
    sns.histplot(data_df[variable], color="red", kde=True)
    plt.title(variable)

    # Log-transformed histogram
    plt.subplot(2, 4, i + 5)
    log_variable = np.log(data_df[variable] + 1)  # Adding 1 to avoid log(0)
    sns.histplot(log_variable, color="blue", kde=True)
    plt.title(f"log_{variable}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


# The distinction is evident; in the blue histogram, the peak is noticeably lower than in the red histogram.
# 
#  When you use the logarithm on data, **compresses** the outliers closer to the rest of the values. This makes the distribution of the data look more like a balanced and symmetrical shape, similar to a bell curve. 
#  - It's important to note that log transformation doesn't remove outliers entirely; it reduces their impact.
#   
# Now that we've addressed negative values and outliers, lets quickly inspect the first row of your DataFrame after sorting by index.

# In[85]:


data_df.sort_index().head(3)


# ### Creating Variables

# In this part, we'll demonstrate how useful it is to **create temporary variables**. The benefits of using temporary variables include ensuring the integrity of the original data, particularly during complex operations. 
# 
# Previously, we retained missing values in the `closed_at` variable to preserve information (as certain startups are still active without arbitrarily assigning a closure date). Creating temporary variables allows us to use the data without making modifications to it.

# In[86]:


data_df = data_df

#We convert the 'closed_at' column to datetime format, handling any conversion errors. 
data_df['closed_at'] = pd.to_datetime(data_df['closed_at'], errors='coerce')

#Sort DataFrame by 'closed_at' in descending order revealing the most recent startup closures.
data_df = data_df.sort_values(by='closed_at', ascending=False )

#Find the last closing date
last_closed_date = data_df['closed_at'].dropna().iloc[0]

#Confirm is the right value
print("Last startup closing date:", last_closed_date)

#temporary variable, 'closed_temp,' is created to preserve non-null values of the 'closed_at' column for calculations.
closed_temp = data_df['closed_at'].copy()

#Fill the null values in 'closed_temp' with the last closed date(2013-10-30)
closed_temp.fillna(last_closed_date, inplace=True)

#Calculate the relative age based on 'founded_at' and 'closed_temp'
data_df['age'] = ((closed_temp - data_df['founded_at']).dt.days / 365.25).round(4)

#Missing values in 'closed_at' are replaced with 'x' to signify operating startups.
data_df['closed_at'] = data_df['closed_at'].fillna(value="x")

#'Missing values in 'closed_at' are replaced with 'x' to signify operating startups.
data_df['closed_at'] = data_df.closed_at.apply(lambda x: 1 if x =='x' else 0)

# Convert 'founded_at' column to datetime objects
data_df['founded_at'] = pd.to_datetime(data_df['founded_at'])

# Extract and format the year from 'founded_at' as 'founded_year'
data_df['founded_year'] = data_df['founded_at'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Group the DataFrame by 'founded_year' and count occurrences
prop_df = data_df.groupby('founded_year').size().reset_index(name = 'counts')

# Calculate the proportions of startups founded each year
prop_df['proportions'] = prop_df['counts']/prop_df['counts'].sum()


# To summarize the steps we've taken:

# 
# - Create a temporary variable, `closed_temp` to hold non-null values from `closed_at`.
# - Fill the null values in `closed_temp` with the last closed date (2013-10-30).
# - Calculate the relative age based on `founded_at` and `closed_temp`.
# - Replace missing values in `closed_at` with 'x' to indicate operating startups.
# - Generate an additional variables named `founded_year` and `proportions` to create visualization.

data_df.sort_index().head(1)


# ### Transforming Non-numeric Data into Numeric Values

# Just like we did with our target variables previously, let's apply the **mapping** technique again to convert the remaining categorical features into numerical ones. 
# 

# In[88]:

# ## Recap of Data Preprocessing ####

# After a comprehensive preprocessing transformation, we will outline the general steps we have taken with our data to improve its quality and gain more accurate insights.
# 
# - Filtering Irrelevant Values: We simplified the dataframe by reducing the number of variables from 50 to 24, removing unnecessary ones.
# 
# - Handling Missing Values: Identified and managed missing values through imputation techniques.
# 
# - Addressing Negative Values: Utilized Box Plot and Scatter Plot methods to detect negative values, then handling them with the np.abs() function.
# 
# - Managing Outliers: Employed Histogram and z-score methods for outlier detection and subsequently addressed them using log-transformed technique.
# 
# - Temporary Variable Creation: Implemented temporary variables to facilitate complex calculations without altering the original dataset.
# 
# - Conversion of Non-numeric Data: Converted non-numeric data into numeric values to improve analytical capabilities and model compatibility.
# 
# 
# After finally improving the quality of the data, we can now proceed to the most interesting part: getting some insights.

# ##  Ignore: (Changes for modeling)

# Additionally, by dropping the original datetime columns, the DataFrame becomes more concise and efficient for subsequent modeling tasks.

# The data indicates that startups achieving up to four milestones have a significantly higher likelihood of being acquired than those that dont.
# 
# -  Startups reaching 2-4 milestones have a higher chance of being acquired, emphasizing early success.

# While the number of acquisitions decreases after reaching four milestones, the data consistently shows that achieving milestones positively influences a startup's likelihood of being acquired.
#  
# This trend reinforces the value of setting and reaching milestones as a strategy for startups aiming to get acquired and succeed in the industry

# It shows that the majority of startups that received round D funding were acquired rather than closed.

# From the histogram we can point the following: 
# 
# Most startups, whether acquired or closed, tend to have lower levels of total funding, with the likelihood of either acquisition or closure diminishing as funding amounts increase.
# 
# While it's not universally true for every startup, the pattern of increased funding correlating with reduced risk of acquisition or closure is commonly observed in the startup ecosystem.

# ##  Data-driven conclusions

# After a depth analysis of the variables,  it's apparent that certain factors strongly influence the likelihood of startups being acquired. These include number of business relationships, number and timing of milestones reached, types of investment, alongside the historical record of fundings are significant factors to consider.
# 
# Data preprocessing played a key role in turning raw information into practical insights. Critical steps as imputation techniques, identifying negative and missing values and carefully addressing outliers provided meaningful and accurate information about the underlying patterns. 
# 
# Keeping in mind that every technique will be used differently depending on the nature of the data. 
# 
# Visual representations enable us to decode intricate relationships, recognize trends, and making it more accessible and intuitive for interpretation.
# 
# By following this workflow, a data analysis project becomes more manageable, efficient, and produces reliable results that can inform critical decisions in various domains, including startup success prediction.
